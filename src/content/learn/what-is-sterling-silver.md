## What is Sterling Silver?

Sterling silver, commonly marked as **925 silver**, is an alloy containing 92.5% pure silver and 7.5% other metals, usually copper. This composition makes it more durable than pure silver while maintaining its beautiful lustrous appearance.

## Why 92.5% Silver?

Pure silver (999 silver) is too soft for most practical applications. It scratches easily and can deform under pressure. By adding 7.5% copper or other metals, jewelers create a material that:

- **Is more durable** for everyday wear
- **Holds intricate designs** better
- **Resists scratches** and dents
- **Maintains its shape** over time

## How to Identify Sterling Silver

### Hallmarks to Look For

Genuine sterling silver is marked with one of these hallmarks:

1. **925** - The most common mark
2. **Sterling** - Written out in full
3. **Ster** - Abbreviated form
4. **SS** - Short form (less common)
5. **BIS Hallmark** - In India, look for the Bureau of Indian Standards mark

### Physical Tests

You can also verify sterling silver through:

- **Magnet Test**: Silver is not magnetic. If it sticks to a magnet, it's not real silver.
- **Ice Test**: Silver conducts heat excellently. Ice melts faster on silver than most other metals.
- **Smell Test**: Real silver has no odor. A strong metallic smell indicates other metals.
