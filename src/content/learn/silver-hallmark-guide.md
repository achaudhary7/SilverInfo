## What is a Silver Hallmark?

A silver hallmark is an official mark stamped on silver articles that certifies their purity and authenticity. In India, the **Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)** is responsible for hallmarking precious metals, including silver.

Hallmarking was made mandatory for gold jewelry in 2021, and silver hallmarking is increasingly important for consumer protection.

## Understanding BIS Silver Hallmarks

### Components of a BIS Hallmark

A genuine BIS silver hallmark consists of three main components:

1. **BIS Logo** - The triangular BIS standard mark
2. **Purity Grade** - Indicates the silver content (e.g., 999, 925, 900)
3. **HUID** - Hallmark Unique Identification Number (6-digit alphanumeric code)

### Silver Purity Grades in India

| Grade | Silver Content | Common Use |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| 999 | 99.9% pure | Coins, bars, investment |
| 990 | 99.0% pure | High-quality articles |
| 970 | 97.0% pure | Premium jewelry |
| 925 | 92.5% pure | Sterling silver jewelry |
| 900 | 90.0% pure | Traditional jewelry |
| 835 | 83.5% pure | Some European silver |

## How to Verify BIS Hallmarked Silver

### Step 1: Locate the Hallmark

The hallmark is usually stamped on:
- Inside of rings and bangles
- Back of pendants and earrings
- Handle or base of utensils
- Edge of silver bars and coins

### Step 2: Check for All Components

Ensure you can see:
- The BIS triangle logo
- The purity number (999, 925, etc.)
- The HUID code

### Step 3: Verify Online

You can verify the HUID online:

1. Visit the BIS HUID verification portal
2. Enter the 6-digit HUID code
3. View the article details and jeweler information

**Note**: The BIS verification portal is available at [bis.gov.in](https://bis.gov.in)

## Common Hallmark Frauds to Avoid

### Fake Hallmarks

Watch out for:
- Blurry or poorly stamped marks
- Missing HUID codes
- Incorrect logo designs
- Marks that can be easily rubbed off

### Silver-Plated Items

Some sellers may claim silver-plated items are solid silver. Check for:
- "Silver Plated" or "EPNS" markings (not real silver)
- Unusually low prices
- Thin, lightweight feel

### German Silver Warning

**German Silver is NOT real silver**. Despite the name, German Silver (also called Nickel Silver) contains:
- Copper: 60%
- Nickel: 20%
- Zinc: 20%
- Silver: 0%

Always ask for BIS hallmark to avoid this common confusion.

## Benefits of Buying Hallmarked Silver

1. **Guaranteed Purity** - You know exactly what you're paying for
2. **Fair Pricing** - Price is based on actual silver content
3. **Resale Value** - Easier to sell with verified purity
4. **Consumer Protection** - Legal recourse if hallmark is fake
5. **Quality Assurance** - Tested by authorized centers

## Where to Buy Hallmarked Silver

### Authorized Retailers

Buy from BIS-certified jewelers who:
- Display their BIS license prominently
- Provide proper invoices with HUID
- Offer exchange and buyback policies

### What to Ask Before Buying

1. Is this article BIS hallmarked?
2. Can I see the hallmark clearly?
3. What is the HUID number?
4. Do you provide a certificate of authenticity?
