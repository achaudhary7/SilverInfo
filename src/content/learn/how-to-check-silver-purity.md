## Why Check Silver Purity?

Before buying or selling silver, it's crucial to verify its authenticity. Fake silver and silver-plated items are common in the market. These simple tests can help you identify genuine silver without expensive equipment.

## Quick Reference: Silver Purity Marks

| Marking | Silver Content | Quality |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| 999 | 99.9% | Fine/Pure Silver |
| 970 | 97.0% | Britannia Silver |
| 925 | 92.5% | Sterling Silver |
| 900 | 90.0% | Coin Silver |
| 800 | 80.0% | European Silver |

## 10 Methods to Test Silver Purity

### 1. The Hallmark Check (Most Reliable)

**What to Do**:
Look for official stamps on the silver item.

**What to Look For**:
- BIS triangle logo (India)
- Purity number (999, 925, etc.)
- HUID code (6-digit alphanumeric)

**Reliability**: Very High

**Note**: Some antique pieces may not have modern hallmarks but can still be genuine.

### 2. The Magnet Test

**What You Need**: A strong magnet (neodymium works best)

**How to Test**:
1. Hold the magnet close to the silver item
2. Observe the reaction

**Results**:
- **No attraction** = Possibly real silver (silver is not magnetic)
- **Strong attraction** = Definitely NOT silver
- **Slight attraction** = May contain magnetic metals mixed in

**Reliability**: Medium (rules out obvious fakes)

### 3. The Ice Test

**What You Need**: Ice cube

**How to Test**:
1. Place an ice cube on the silver item
2. Watch how quickly it melts

**Results**:
Silver has the highest thermal conductivity of any metal. If the ice melts unusually fast compared to other metals, it's likely real silver.

**Reliability**: Medium

### 4. The Ring Test (Sound Test)

**What to Do**:
Tap the silver item gently with another metal object.

**Results**:
- **Real silver**: High-pitched, bell-like ring that sustains
- **Fake silver**: Dull thud or short ring

**Best For**: Coins and bars

**Reliability**: Medium (requires experience)

### 5. The Smell Test

**How to Test**:
Clean the item and smell it closely.

**Results**:
- **Real silver**: No smell or very faint metallic odor
- **Fake silver**: Strong metallic smell, sulfur, or copper odor

**Reliability**: Low to Medium

### 6. The Bleach Test (Caution Required)

**Warning**: This test can discolor your silver. Use only on non-visible areas.

**How to Test**:
1. Apply a tiny drop of bleach to an inconspicuous spot
2. Wait 1-2 minutes
3. Wipe and observe

**Results**:
- **Real silver**: Turns black or dark (tarnishes quickly)
- **Fake silver**: No reaction or different color change

**Reliability**: High (but damages the item)

### 7. The Nitric Acid Test (Professional)

**Warning**: Acid is dangerous. This is typically done by jewelers.

**How to Test**:
1. Make a small scratch on an inconspicuous area
2. Apply nitric acid to the scratch

**Results**:
- **Real silver**: Creamy white color
- **Sterling silver**: Light green color
- **Fake silver**: Green, brown, or other colors

**Reliability**: Very High

### 8. The Weight and Feel Test

**What to Know**:
Silver is denser than most common metals.

**Silver Density**: 10.49 g/cm³

**How to Test**:
1. Feel the weight of the item
2. Compare to items of similar size made of other metals

**Results**:
Real silver feels heavier than aluminum, steel, or most fakes.

**Reliability**: Low (requires experience)

### 9. The Tarnish Test

**What to Know**:
Real silver tarnishes over time when exposed to air and sulfur compounds.

**Observations**:
- **Real silver**: Develops a yellowish, then black patina
- **Silver-plated**: May show base metal peeking through
- **Stainless steel**: Does not tarnish

**Reliability**: Medium (requires time)

### 10. XRF Testing (Most Accurate)

**What It Is**: X-Ray Fluorescence analysis

**Where to Get It**: Jewelry stores, assay offices, pawn shops

**Results**: Provides exact percentage of all metals in the item

**Reliability**: Highest (but costs money)

## Red Flags: Signs of Fake Silver

Watch out for these warning signs:

1. **Price too good to be true** - Genuine silver has market value
2. **"German Silver" label** - Contains no actual silver
3. **"Silver-plated" or "EPNS"** - Only surface coating
4. **Flaking or peeling** - Indicates plating
5. **Green residue on skin** - Usually copper or nickel
6. **No hallmarks** - Legitimate sellers mark their products
7. **Extremely light weight** - May be aluminum

## Common Silver Fakes in India

| Fake Type | Composition | How to Spot |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| German Silver | Copper, Zinc, Nickel | No hallmark, different color |
| Silver-Plated | Base metal + thin silver | Wear marks showing brass/copper |
| Nickel Silver | Nickel alloy | More grey, no tarnish |
| Aluminum | Aluminum | Very light weight |

## When to Get Professional Testing

Consider professional verification when:
- Buying expensive antique silver
- Large investment purchases
- No visible hallmarks
- Inheriting family silver
- Selling for best price

## Cost of Professional Testing

| Service | Approximate Cost |
|---------|-----------------|
| Visual Inspection | Free - ₹200 |
| Acid Test | ₹100 - ₹300 |
| XRF Analysis | ₹500 - ₹1,500 |
| BIS Hallmarking | ₹45 per article |

## Conclusion

While no single home test is 100% conclusive, combining multiple tests gives you a reliable indication of silver authenticity. For valuable pieces, always get professional verification. And remember, buying from BIS-certified jewelers with proper hallmarks is the safest approach.
