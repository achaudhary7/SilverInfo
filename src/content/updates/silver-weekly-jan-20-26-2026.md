## What Happened This Week

### Market Trend

Silver showed **strong bullish momentum** this week, gaining over 4.5%. The rally was driven by multiple factors:

1. **Republic Day demand surge** - Festive buying pushed prices higher
2. **Global COMEX rally** - International silver crossed $103/oz
3. **Rupee depreciation** - Weaker INR added to domestic prices
4. **Pre-budget positioning** - Industrial buyers stocking up ahead of Union Budget

### Outlook for Next Week

The bullish trend may continue into Budget week, though some profit-booking could lead to minor corrections after the sharp rally. Support lies at the weekly low of ₹378.50/gram.

Key trigger: **Union Budget 2026 on February 1** - Watch for:
- Import duty changes on precious metals
- GST modifications affecting jewelry sector
- Solar energy incentives boosting industrial demand
