## Why Did Silver Prices Rise Today?

### 1. Global COMEX Rally

International silver prices on COMEX surged past the **$103 per ounce** level – a significant psychological barrier. This rally was driven by:

- **Increased ETF inflows** into silver-backed funds
- **Industrial demand** from solar panel manufacturers
- **Speculative buying** ahead of US Fed meeting

The COMEX price directly impacts Indian rates since India imports over 90% of its silver requirements.

### 2. Rupee Depreciation

The Indian Rupee weakened to **₹91.86 per USD**, making silver imports more expensive. Every 1% fall in the Rupee typically adds 1% to domestic silver prices.

**Why the Rupee weakened:**
- Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) pulling out equity investments
- Rising crude oil prices increasing import bills
- Dollar strength ahead of Federal Reserve announcements

### 3. Pre-Budget Industrial Buying

With Union Budget 2026 just around the corner, industrial buyers are stockpiling silver anticipating potential:

- **Import duty changes** on precious metals
- **GST modifications** affecting jewelry sector
- **Solar energy incentives** boosting industrial demand

### 4. Technical Breakout

Silver broke above the key resistance level of ₹375/gram, triggering:

- **Stop-loss hunting** pushing prices higher
- **Momentum buying** from technical traders
- **Short covering** by bears caught off-guard

## What Should Investors Do?

### If You're Looking to Buy

- **Wait for pullback**: After a 8%+ rally, some profit-booking is likely
- **Don't chase prices**: Buying at weekly highs increases risk
- **Consider SIP approach**: Spread purchases over time
- **Use our calculator**: [Calculate exact costs →](/silver-price-calculator)

### If You're Holding Silver

- **Review your targets**: Is it time to book partial profits?
- **Check breakeven**: Use our [break-even calculator →](/break-even-calculator)
- **Hold for long-term**: If your horizon is 3+ years, short-term volatility matters less

### If You're Planning to Sell

- **Today might be good**: Weekly highs offer favorable exit
- **Compare buyback rates**: Check multiple jewelers
- **Keep documentation**: Original invoice speeds up selling
