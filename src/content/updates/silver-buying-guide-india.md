## Understanding Silver Pricing

### Components of Silver Price

| Component | Percentage | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Metal Value | Base | Current market rate per gram |
| Making Charges | 6-15% | Labor cost for crafting |
| GST | 3% | Government tax on total |
| Wastage | 0-5% | Some jewelers add this |

### Sample Calculation (10g Silver Jewelry)

*Example using illustrative rate - check [live prices](/) for current rates*

```
Silver Rate: [Current Rate]/gram (check live price)
Metal Value: 10g × [Current Rate]
Making Charges (10%): [10% of Metal Value]
Subtotal: [Metal Value + Making Charges]
GST (3%): [3% of Subtotal]
Total: [Subtotal + GST]
```

**Quick Tip**: Use our [Silver Calculator](/silver-price-calculator) to get exact costs with current prices automatically!

## Checking Silver Purity

### Look for BIS Hallmark

The hallmark should include:
1. **BIS Logo** - Triangle mark
2. **Purity Number** - 999, 925, 900, etc.
3. **HUID** - 6-digit unique code

### Home Testing Methods

1. **Magnet Test**: Silver is not magnetic
2. **Ice Test**: Ice melts faster on real silver
3. **Sound Test**: Real silver rings when tapped

### Professional Testing

For large purchases, consider XRF testing at a certified lab (costs ₹500-1,500).

## Understanding Price Patterns

*Note: This is educational information about historical patterns, not a recommendation on when to buy.*

### Historical Observations

- Silver prices fluctuate daily based on global markets
- Prices may vary during different seasons due to demand
- MCX trading hours: 9 AM - 11:30 PM IST (Mon-Fri)

### Cultural Buying Occasions (Traditional)

Many people in India traditionally purchase silver during:
- Dhanteras
- Akshaya Tritiya
- Diwali

*Prices may be higher during these periods due to increased demand.*

### Price Tracking Tools

## Negotiation Tips

### What's Negotiable

2. **Wastage**: Should be zero for machine-made items
3. **Exchange Rate**: Ask for better buyback terms

### How to Negotiate

Always get a proper GST invoice with HUID.

### 4. Confusing Silver-Plated with Real Silver
German Silver and EPNS are NOT real silver.

Same item can vary by ₹500-1,000 across sellers.
