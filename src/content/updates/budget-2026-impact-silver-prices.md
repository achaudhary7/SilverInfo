## Expected Budget Announcements

### 1. Import Duty Changes (High Probability)

**Current Situation:**
- Import duty on silver: **7.5%**
- India imports ~5,500-6,500 tonnes of silver annually
- One of the largest silver importing nations globally

**Expected Changes:**

| Scenario | New Duty | Impact on Prices |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| **Duty Cut** | 5% | Prices ↓ ₹8,000-10,000/kg |
| **Status Quo** | 7.5% | Neutral |
| **Duty Hike** | 10% | Prices ↑ ₹10,000-12,000/kg |

**Expert View:** Most analysts expect a **slight reduction** to 5-6% to boost the jewelry industry and align with gold duty cuts from previous years.

### 2. GST Modifications (Low Probability)

**Current GST Structure:**
- Silver (bullion/coins): **3%**
- Silver jewelry: **3%** + 5% on making
- Silver articles: **3%**

**Expected:** GST rates are **unlikely to change** as the GST Council, not the Finance Minister, decides these rates. However, the budget might announce:

- Simplified GST filing for jewelers
- Input tax credit improvements
- Composition scheme expansion

### 3. Solar Energy Incentives (High Probability)

**Why This Matters for Silver:**
- Silver is essential in solar panel manufacturing
- Each solar panel uses ~20g of silver
- India's 500GW renewable energy target by 2030

**Expected Announcements:**
- PLI scheme extension for solar manufacturing
- Subsidies for domestic silver processing
- Tax breaks for silver used in solar panels

**Impact:** Industrial silver demand could surge **15-20%** if incentives are significant.

### 4. Hallmarking & Compliance

**Expected Measures:**
- Stricter BIS hallmarking enforcement
- Digital trail for silver transactions
- PAN card requirement threshold might change

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will silver prices fall after budget?

It depends on import duty changes. A duty cut could reduce prices by ₹5,000-10,000/kg, while a duty hike could increase them.

### Should I buy silver before or after budget?

If you expect duty to increase, buy now. If you expect a cut, wait till after budget. Uncertain? Split your purchase.

### Will GST on silver change?

Unlikely. GST rates are decided by GST Council, not the budget. The 3% rate has been stable since 2017.

### How will solar incentives affect silver?

Industrial demand could increase 15-20%, supporting prices. However, this is a gradual effect, not immediate.
