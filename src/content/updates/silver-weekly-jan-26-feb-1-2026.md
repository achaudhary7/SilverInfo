### Market Trend

Silver showed **strong bullish momentum** this week, crossing the critical **₹400 mark** that was resistance for months. The rally was supported by:

- 💱 Rupee weakness supporting imports
- 🏭 Industrial demand staying robust

### Outlook for Next Week

With ₹400 now acting as **support** (previous resistance), the next targets are:
- Immediate: ₹405-410
- Medium-term: ₹420 (all-time high)

Some profit-booking possible, but overall trend remains bullish.
