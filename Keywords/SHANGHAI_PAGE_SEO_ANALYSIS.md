## 3. Remaining Keywords to Handle “Correctly”

- **Already well covered:** Shanghai silver price (today/live/USD/dollars), SGE silver price, COMEX vs Shanghai, premium, trading hours, VAT (FAQ), benchmark, Ag(T+D), CNY/kg, German/Hindi sections, dynamic date.
- **Improve without stuffing:**
  - **“current shfe silver price cny per kg” / “current sge silver price cny per kg”**  
    Ensure one clear H2 or table caption containing “Current SGE/SHFE silver price (CNY per kg)” and the live value.
  - **“unit of shanghai silver benchmark price sge”**  
    Add one FAQ: “What unit is Shanghai silver price quoted in?” (already present) and optionally one short paragraph in “What is the Shanghai Silver Benchmark Price?” with “CNY per kilogram (kg)”.
  - **“shanghai silver price in usd” / “shanghai silver price”**  
    Keep in title and meta; ensure H1 or first paragraph uses “Shanghai silver price” and “Shanghai silver price in USD” naturally once.
- **Date-based (e.g. january 26/28 2026):** Already handled by dynamic title and “today” wording; no extra pages needed.
- **VAT (does … include vat?):** Already in FAQ; ensure FAQ schema and visible Q&A match exactly.

## 4. AI Overview & Featured Snippet Readiness

- **Technical:** Page is indexable, snippet-eligible, has internal links and textual content → eligible for AI Overview links and featured snippets.
- **Content:** FAQ schema + clear Q&A + direct answers (e.g. “Shanghai silver price today is…”, “SGE silver price is…”, “No, SGE silver prices do NOT include VAT”) support both.
- **Refinements:**  
  - Keep FAQ answers concise and fact-first.  
  - Ensure FAQPage `mainEntity` matches visible questions and answers 1:1.  
  - Add/verify one sentence in body or FAQ for “unit of Shanghai silver benchmark price” (CNY/kg).
